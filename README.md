Whack-a-Dook
  It is pride month, so naturally I wanted to include the Babadook (a gay icon) in my project. The user is playing as the mother from the film who is attempting to defeat the Babadook while avoiding murdering her child. The game starts when the user clicks the start button which begins the 1 minute timer and the Babadook, Babadook pop-up book and screaming child images begin to pop up randomly in the tiles. For each Babadook and Babadook pop-up book clicked the user gains points and if the screaming child is clicked it is game over. Try to get as many points as possible before either the timer is up or you kill your child (oops).
